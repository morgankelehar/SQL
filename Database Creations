# Airline Information

During my Database Management Systems Concepts and Design course at Missouri State, we used Oracle SQL to create our own database. 

## Background information:
This database tracks specific flight information. It starts out with a ticket that will keep track of the customer, flight number, departure airport, and the arrival airport. 
Additionally, the flight will keep track of the departure and arrival airports, the employees working, and other important information. This information will help the airlines 
keep track of the different elements that go into a flight and ensure consistency and clarity of information between them and the customers. These simple ERD diagrams can be 
expanded upon to add entities for the company, specific planes, seat numbers, and more.

## ERD Level 0:
